## How to Report Bugs

Bug reports help us maintain high quality and reliability. When reporting a bug, follow these steps:

### 1. Before Submitting

- **Search Existing Issues**: Check existing open and closed GitHub issues to see if the bug has already been reported.
- **Verify on Latest Main**: Ensure the bug reproduces on the latest commit of the `main` branch.

### 2. Submitting a Bug Report

Open a new issue using the **Bug Report** template and provide the following details:

- **Clear Title**: A concise, descriptive summary of the problem (e.g., `[Bug]: Manifest hash calculation fails on empty metadata`).
- **Description**: A clear summary of the bug and the context in which it occurs.
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue:
  1. Go to '...'
  2. Click on '....'
  3. Scroll down to '....'
  4. See error
- **Expected Behavior**: What you expected to happen.
- **Actual Behavior**: What actually happened, including exact error messages and stack traces.
- **Environment**:
  - OS & Version (e.g., Ubuntu 22.04, macOS Sonoma 14.5, Windows 11 WSL2)
  - Node.js & pnpm versions (`node -v`, `pnpm -v`)
  - Rust & Stellar CLI versions (`rustc -v`, `stellar --version`)
  - Browser & Wallet extension version (e.g., Chrome 128, Freighter 6.0.1)
- **Screenshots / Recordings**: Visual evidence if the bug is UI-related.

## How to Suggest Features

We welcome ideas for new features and enhancements! To submit a feature proposal:

### 1. Before Submitting

- Search existing issues and discussions to avoid duplicate suggestions.
- Ensure the proposal aligns with Stellar-Veriphy's mission of decentralized content provenance and verification.

### 2. Submitting a Feature Request

Open a new issue using the **Feature Request** template including:

- **Feature Title**: A clear, concise name for the proposed feature.
- **Problem Statement**: What problem does this solve? What use cases does it address?
- **Proposed Solution**: A detailed description of how the feature should work, including suggested UI flows or API/contract changes.
- **Alternatives Considered**: Other approaches or workarounds you considered and why the proposed solution is preferred.
- **Additional Context**: Any mockups, diagrams, code snippets, or reference links.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed:

| Tool                 | Required Version                           | Purpose                                           |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Node.js**          | `>= 20.0.0`                                | Frontend and shared tooling                       |
| **pnpm**             | `>= 10.18.2`                               | Workspace package manager                         |
| **Rust**             | `stable` (`wasm32-unknown-unknown` target) | Soroban smart contracts                           |
| **Stellar CLI**      | `latest`                                   | Contract compilation and deployment               |
| **Freighter Wallet** | `latest`                                   | Browser extension for Stellar wallet interactions |

Install Rust WASM target:

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

Install Stellar CLI:

```bash
cargo install --locked stellar-cli --features opt
```

### Environment Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Stellar-Veriphy/Stellar-Veriphy.git
   cd Stellar-Veriphy
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   cp .env.local.example .env.local
   ```

   Update `.env.local` with the appropriate network RPC URLs and contract IDs.

### Running the Project

#### Frontend

```bash
# Start development server
pnpm dev:frontend

# Build for production
pnpm build:frontend

# Run linting
pnpm check:frontend
```

The frontend will run at `http://localhost:3000`.

#### Smart Contracts

```bash
# Build all contracts (oracle, provenance, registry)
pnpm build:contracts

# Run contract tests
cd contracts/oracle && cargo test
cd ../provenance && cargo test
cd ../registry && cargo test
```

## Coding Standards

For detailed conventions, please consult [STYLE-GUIDE.md](./STYLE-GUIDE.md).

### TypeScript & React Standards

- **Strict Typing**: TypeScript strict mode is enabled. **Do not use `any`**. Use `unknown` with type guards, specific interfaces, or generics instead.
- **Naming Conventions**:
  - **PascalCase**: Components (`CertificateCard.tsx`), Interfaces/Types (`ContentManifest`, `VerificationResult`), Enums.
  - **camelCase**: Functions (`verifyManifest`), variables, custom hooks (`useWallet`), service files (`transactionService.ts`).
  - **UPPER_SNAKE_CASE**: Constants (`DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_MS`).
- **Component Design**:
  - Place hooks first, followed by derived state, event handlers, and finally return JSX.
  - Explicitly type component props using `interface Props` or `type Props`.
  - Use Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling.
  - Ensure accessibility: use semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation support, and descriptive alt text.
- **Imports**: Group imports cleanly:
  1. Framework / Next / React imports
  2. External dependencies (`lucide-react`, `zustand`, etc.)
  3. Internal aliases (`@/...`, `@stellarveriphy/shared/...`)
  4. Relative imports (`./`, `../`)
  5. Type-only imports with `import type { ... }`

### Rust & Soroban Contract Standards

- **Safety & Quality**: All Soroban contracts must avoid unsafe blocks, unhandled panics, and arithmetic overflows (use checked or saturating math).
- **Naming Conventions**:
  - **PascalCase**: Structs, enums, traits (`OracleContract`, `AttestationRecord`).
  - **snake_case**: Functions, module names, variables (`verify_proof`, `token_id`).
  - **UPPER_SNAKE_CASE**: Module constants (`MAX_EXPIRY_LEDGERS`).
- **Documentation**: Document all public contract functions and data structures with Rustdoc `///` comments.
- **Gas & Footprint Optimization**: Keep state storage footprints minimal and avoid unbounded loops.

### Formatting and Linting

We enforce automatic formatting and linting via pre-commit hooks (`husky` + `lint-staged`):

- **Frontend**: [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for formatting, then ESLint with TypeScript rules.
- **Contracts**: `rustfmt --edition 2021` and `cargo clippy`.

**Import sorting**: The frontend ESLint config includes `eslint-plugin-simple-import-sort`, which automatically groups and alphabetizes imports and exports (`simple-import-sort/imports`, `simple-import-sort/exports`). This runs as part of `pnpm --filter frontend exec eslint --fix` and the pre-commit hook, so imports are sorted automatically whenever you commit or run lint with `--fix`.
Prettier's config lives at the repo root (`.prettierrc.json`, `.prettierignore`) and covers the
whole workspace — TypeScript/JavaScript, JSON, CSS, and Markdown. Rust contracts are excluded and
formatted with `rustfmt` instead.

Run manual checks before submitting:

```bash
# Format the whole repo
pnpm format

# Check formatting without writing changes (used in CI)
pnpm format:check

# Check frontend lint
pnpm check:frontend

# Check Rust formatting
cd contracts/oracle && cargo fmt -- --check
```

Staged files are auto-formatted on commit, so running `pnpm format` manually is mostly useful for
formatting a whole directory at once or verifying CI will pass.
