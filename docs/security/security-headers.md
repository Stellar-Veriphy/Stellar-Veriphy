# Security Headers

This document describes the HTTP response headers set in [`frontend/next.config.ts`](../../frontend/next.config.ts) via the Next.js `headers()` API. They apply to every route (`source: "/(.*)"`) and protect against clickjacking, MIME-sniffing, XSS, and protocol-downgrade attacks. Closes #270.

## Header set

## Why `X-XSS-Protection` is included despite being deprecated

Modern browsers removed the legacy XSS auditor this header controls (it caused more security bugs than it fixed) and rely on CSP instead. It's set anyway because it's a zero-cost, zero-risk header for the browsers that still read it, and it was an explicit acceptance-criterion for #270. Do not treat it as the primary XSS defense — that's the `Content-Security-Policy` above.

## Verifying

1. `pnpm build:frontend && pnpm --filter frontend start`, then run:
   ```bash
   curl -sI http://localhost:3000/ | grep -iE "content-security-policy|x-frame-options|x-content-type-options|x-xss-protection|strict-transport-security|referrer-policy|permissions-policy"
   ```
2. Against a deployed instance, run a scan at [securityheaders.com](https://securityheaders.com) — this can't be automated in CI since it requires a publicly reachable URL. Target grade: **A** or better. `Strict-Transport-Security` only has real effect over HTTPS, so this step must be run against the deployed (HTTPS) site, not `localhost`.

## Changing the policy

Any new external host the app needs to talk to (a new RPC provider, a new IPFS gateway, etc.) must be added to the relevant CSP directive in `cspValue` — do not widen `script-src`/`connect-src` to a wildcard to avoid updating this list, since that reopens the exact injection surface CSP exists to close.
